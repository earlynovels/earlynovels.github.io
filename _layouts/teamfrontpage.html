<p>END team members come from a number of institutions and bring a host of different forms of expertise and experience to our project. Each summer, we assemble a team of student researchers for an intense 10-week sprint during which we work together to create metadata, conceive and carry out personal and collective projects, visit other libraries, host visiting speakers, and participate in the END Summer Seminar.</p>
